## FAQ

> Will BountyMachine be open sourced? When will it be released? etc..

We currently have no plans to open source/release BountyMachine publicly. We are exploring potential commercial/hosted options, and may allow some form of access through those mechanisms in future. The team is comitted to open access, open source, and sharing in general; so we are actively considering and exploring what aspects we can share/talk more about/etc without compromising our core. If you want to talk more about this, or have ideas, please hit us up!
